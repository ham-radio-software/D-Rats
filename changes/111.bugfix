Some platform D-RATS program can not exchange files with programs running on
other platforms.  D-Rats was incorrectly sending the file size in
native-endian format instead of network-endian format.

D-RAts is now sending the file size in little-endian format instead of
network-endian format to be compatible with the majority of existing
D-rats programs in use.

Users of D-Rats on big-endian platforms need to upgrade to this version
of d-rats.
