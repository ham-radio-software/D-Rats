IF YOU ARE ALREADY A USER OF D-RATS

COMPATIBILITY NOTES
** D-RATS 0.3.5 --> 0.3.9** 
This version share the same configuration file of 0.3.5 - there are no actions
to be done.

** D-RATS 0.3.4 ** 
This version, like 0.3.5, need a configuration file which is different from
0.3.4, so please remove or delete it:

C:\Users\YOUR-USER-NAME\AppData\Roaming\D-RATS-EV\d-rats.config

** D-RATS <= 0.3.3 ** 
This version will create its own data folder in parallel to the one created
by former d-Rats 0.3.3 install, so not to interfere.


--------------------------------------
IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME USER OF D-RATS

D-rats can be run from a copy of the git repository you found it in.
However you will need to build the message catalogs for internationalization
to work and lzhuf for winlink support.
At some point we need some documentation for those steps.

See the file README.md for more details.
